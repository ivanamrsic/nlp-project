One reviewer gave a low rating mentioning how the first episode showed her using pills in the orphanage....yes they had to as it shapes the rest of her future. The characters are great and the acting on is superb. Kept me hooked!")

This is one of the best 5 series I have ever watched and I have seen a lot! It is very under-rated in my opinion. Just for reference I consider no.1 The Wire.")

        let r3 = Review(movie: "Twilight (2008)", title: "Guilty pleasure", date: "7 August 2018", text:"If I saw the movie now for the first time I know I probably will hate it, but the 11 year old me was so love struck with it. Honestly no movie these days makes me this happy anymore. Also I think this one (the first movie) is so much cinematically pleasing. I enjoy the dark blue rainy vibe & the shaky camera a lot. This movie is my guilty pleasure. 10 for the nostalgia feelings.")
